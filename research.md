My research interests lie mostly in language variation and change (LVC); that
is, I study the social and linguistic predictors that underlie language
variation, as well as how that variation leads to change over time.
Particularly, I'm interested in stylistic variation, discourse-pragmatic markers
(especially *um*, *uh* and other “sublexical” markers like hm), subject drop, and
anything to do with language on the internet.

## *Um* and *uh*

For my M.A. degree paper, I conducted a study of *um* and *uh* in instant messaging
(IM) under the supervision of [Derek Denis](https://derekdenis.com/).

Recent variationist work (e.g., Wieling et al., 2016) has identified a change in
progress: *um* is rising in frequency relative to *uh*, which might be related to an
emerging functional difference between the two. My goal was to explore that idea
using IM data, in which the use of the words seems to be more intentional: while
some would argue we “automatically” produce them in speech, using them in IM
requires more conscious effort and thus may provide clues as to their
discourse-pragmatic function.

I'm currently working on extending the findings of my M.A. paper with an
experiment: I'm using a matched-guise design to identify listeners'
social/interactional evaluations of speakers depending on whether and how they
use *uh*, *um*, neither or both.

## Other research interests

Apart from LVC, I'm also interested in the linguistics of Japanese: both in
phonology (e.g., mora-timing) and in syntax/semantics (e.g., sluicing and island
effects, relative clauses, and adjectival modifiers).
