I grew up in London, Ontario and went to high school in Whitby, Ontario. I've
been in Toronto since 2013, where I live with my partner,
[Aileen](https://www.aileenlin.com), and two rabbits: Lulu (shown below) and
Spoon.

Other than linguistics, some of my interests include
[kendo](https://uoftkendo.club) (though it's been a long time since I've found
time to practice), board games, taking pictures, and free and open software
(GNU/Linux, etc.).
Lately I've been getting more into programming, especially [functional
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), and am
currently working on learning Haskell.
(This site is built using [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll), a Haskell
library for generating static sites.)
I've played the violin since I was little
and I love listening to and discovering new music.
