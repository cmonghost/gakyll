            <h1>Research</h1>
            <p>I am a sociolinguist: my research centers on the social aspects of language. I’m particularly interested in discourse-pragmatic markers (especially <em>uh</em> and <em>um</em>) and how their pragmatic and social meanings develop.</p>
<h2 id="um-and-uh"><em>Um</em> and <em>uh</em></h2>
<p>For my M.A. degree paper, I conducted a study of <em>um</em> and <em>uh</em> in instant messaging (IM) under the supervision of <a href="https://derekdenis.com/">Derek Denis</a>.</p>
<p>Recent variationist work (e.g., Wieling et al., 2016) has identified a change in progress: <em>um</em> is rising in frequency relative to <em>uh</em>, which might be related to an emerging functional difference between the two. My goal was to explore that idea using IM data, in which the use of the words seems to be more intentional: while some would argue we “automatically” produce them in speech, using them in IM requires more conscious effort and thus may provide clues as to their discourse-pragmatic function.</p>
<p>I’m currently working on extending the findings of my M.A. paper with an experiment: I’m using a matched-guise design to identify listeners’ social/interactional evaluations of speakers depending on whether and how they use <em>uh</em>, <em>um</em>, neither or both.</p>
<h2 id="other-research-interests">Other research interests</h2>
<p>Apart from LVC, I’m also interested in the linguistics of Japanese: both in phonology (e.g., mora-timing) and in syntax/semantics (e.g., sluicing and island effects, relative clauses, and adjectival modifiers).</p>
